ServiceHost.exe needs a configuration file called ServiceHost.exe.config in
order to run. We don't deploy this file because we don't want to overwrite the
configuration settings that you may have set in it.

Instead, we deploy a file called ServiceHost.exe.config.sample. You should use
this file as a guideline for what needs to go into ServiceHost.exe.config.

In particular, the sample file contains a full list of modules that can run in
ServiceHost. Most likely you will only need some of these. For example, for
just running Data Exchange Manager (the new communication solution), you will
need the following in your config file:

<serviceIterationClasses>
  <add value="Powel.Icc.Messaging.DataExchangeManager.ImportApplicationManagerService.ImportApplicationManagerService, ImportApplicationManagerService"/>
  <add value="Powel.Icc.Messaging.DataExchangeManager.DataExchangeManagerService.DataExchangeManagerService, DataExchangeManagerService"/>
</serviceIterationClasses>

For ECP communication: Replace the address localhost with the address of the computer running the ECP/MADES Endpoint.
