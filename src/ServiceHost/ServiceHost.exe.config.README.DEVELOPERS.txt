The file ServiceHost.exe.config (generated from App.config) does not
get deployed during installation. If it did, we would overwrite the
customer's configuration.

Instead we deploy ServiceHost.exe.config.sample. It is important that
this file is kept up-to-date with any new modules added to
ServiceHost.

We also deploy ServiceHost.exe.config.README.txt in order to describe
this mechanism to consultants/admins.
