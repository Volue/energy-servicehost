# README Java

## Eclipse

An Eclipse project for the Java wrapper can be found in the *jna* folder. This project can be used to build the Java wrapper.

_NOTE_: The jna folder is only available in the Java version.

## Ant

There is also a _build.xml_ file for ant in the *jna* folder. This build file can be used to create a jar file that also includes the JNA library.

You can build the wrapper as a jar archive when using the following command:

  ant compile jar

## Examples

There are also examples that can be used from within the Eclipse project.
